Predicting Bank Churn with CatBoost Model

Project Overview
In this project, I aim to predict bank customer churn using advanced machine learning techniques, particularly leveraging the CatBoostClassifier. Customer churn, or the rate at which customers leave a service, is a critical concern for businesses, especially in the banking sector. Identifying and understanding the factors contributing to churn can help financial institutions take proactive measures to retain valuable customers.

Dataset
The dataset contains various features such as customer demographics, transaction history, and interaction data. The target variable, 'Exited,' indicates whether a customer has churned (1) or not (0).

Methodology
My approach involves preprocessing the data, utilizing CatBoost, a powerful gradient boosting algorithm, for predictive modeling, and evaluating the model's performance through metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

Significance
Customer Retention: Predicting churn enables banks to take preemptive actions to retain customers, potentially saving on acquisition costs.

Model Interpretability: CatBoost provides insights into feature importance, aiding in understanding the drivers behind customer churn.

Optimizing Strategies: With a robust predictive model, banks can tailor strategies to address specific factors leading to churn, improving overall customer satisfaction.
